# JavaPlex

## Persistent Homology and Topological Data Analysis Library 


The `JavaPlex` library implements persistent homology and related techniques from computational and applied topology, in a library designed for ease of use, ease of access from Matlab and java-based systems, and ease of extensions for further research projects and approaches.

`JavaPlex` is mainly developed by the [Computational Topology workgroup](http://comptop.stanford.edu) at Stanford University, and is based on previous similar packages from the same group.

For persistent homology and its capabilities, we recommend the survey article [Topology and Data](http://www.ams.org/journals/bull/2009-46-02/S0273-0979-09-01249-X/S0273-0979-09-01249-X.pdf) by Gunnar Carlsson.

## How to get started?

* Take a look at the [documentation overview](https://github.com/appliedtopology/javaplex/wiki/Overview)  
* Take a look at the [latest release](https://github.com/appliedtopology/javaplex/releases/). The tutorial PDF is available for download there (and also [here](http://www.math.colostate.edu/~adams/research/javaplex_tutorial.pdf)). There is also a [tutorial wiki page](https://github.com/appliedtopology/javaplex/wiki/Tutorial).
* From the [latest release](https://github.com/appliedtopology/javaplex/releases/), you can download and start playing with the latest matlab examples.

## For more information

* Read the [wiki page documentation](https://github.com/appliedtopology/javaplex/wiki/Overview)
* Look at the [javadoc documentation](http://appliedtopology.github.io/javaplex/doc/)
